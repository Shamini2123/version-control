Important Git Commands
These two commands make up the bulk of many workflows that use git for version control:
git add: takes a modified file in your working directory and places the modified
version in a staging area for review.
git commit: takes everything from the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot
of the current state of your repository that has a unique identifier.
